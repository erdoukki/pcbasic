170 rem in gw-basic, which write prevails depends on close sequencing
175 rem whichever file gets their buffer flushed last prevails
177 rem not whoever performed the last operation
180 rem let's not test that here - enforce flushing PRINT before PUT
190 close 1: close 3
999 end
10000 print#2, err, erl
10010 resume next
